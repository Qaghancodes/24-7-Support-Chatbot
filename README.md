# 24/7 Support Chatbot
An AI-powered chatbot embedded on a website to answer customer and employee questions instantly. It solves the issue of slow support response times and high ticket volume by providing fast, automated answers. The bot uses natural language processing to handle common inquiries around the clock, vastly improving customer satisfaction. ChatGPT-powered assistants are known to answer questions “super fast” and be available 24/7 custify.com , effectively reducing support backlog and improving service quality. Technical Architecture: Vue.js (frontend chat interface) and Python Flask (backend) with a connection to the OpenAI API (GPT-4) for intent recognition and answer generation. Uses PostgreSQL to log interactions and user data. The chatbot runs on Heroku with GitHub Actions for continuous deployment. Entirely architected and built solo by the engineer, demonstrating full ownership of AI integration and system design.
